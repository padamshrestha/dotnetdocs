# Compiler Error CS0441
'class': a class cannot be both static and sealed  
  
 This error occurs when you declare a class that is both static and sealed. Static classes are inherently sealed, so the sealed modifier is not necessary. To resolve, use one modifier only.  
  
 The following example generates CS0441:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0441.cs  
sealed static class MyClass { }   // CS0441  
```
