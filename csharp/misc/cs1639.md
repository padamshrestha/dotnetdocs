# Compiler Error CS1639
The managed coclass wrapper class signature 'signature' for interface 'interface' is not a valid class name signature  
  
 This error occurs if the metadata for the interface is invalid. This should never occur if the interface was generated using C# or a supported .NET language. Check with the vendor of the interface or verify that the interface assembly was generated successfully.
