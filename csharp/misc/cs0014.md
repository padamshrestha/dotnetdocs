# Compiler Error CS0014
Required file 'file' could not be found  
  
 A file is needed by the compiler but is not on the system. Make sure that the path is correct. If the file is a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] system file, then you may need to repair your installation or else remove and reinstall [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] completely.
