# &#39;Catch&#39; must end with a matching &#39;End Try&#39;
A `Catch` statement appears in your code without a matching `End Try` statement. `Catch` statements must be concluded with an `End Try` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30441  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the `Catch` statement.  
  
2.  Add an `End Try` statement to conclude the block.  
  
## See Also
