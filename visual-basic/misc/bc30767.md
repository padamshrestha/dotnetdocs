# &#39;Get&#39; statements are no longer supported (Visual Basic)
`Get` statements are no longer supported. File I/O functionality is normally available in the `Microsoft.VisualBasic` namespace, but the targeted version of the .NET Compact Framework does not support it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30767  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Perform file operations with functions defined in the <xref:System.IO> namespace.
