# &#39;End Try&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;Try&#39;
`End` `Try` is used to complete a `Try` block, and hence it can only appear at the end of the block. Either you have a redundant `End Try` statement, or your `End``Try` statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding `Try` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30383  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Locate and remove the unnecessary `End Try`.  
  
2.  Move the `End Try` to the appropriate location in your code.
