# Set not permitted
You attempted to change a property whose settings either cannot be set at run time or else can only be set under certain conditions. For example, you may have tried to change the `Appearance`, `ControlBox`,`MinButton`, or `MaxButton` property settings for the form at run time, or you may have tried to set the `Visible` property to `False` for the last remaining visible submenu on a parent menu.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the property and determine under what conditions it can be set.
