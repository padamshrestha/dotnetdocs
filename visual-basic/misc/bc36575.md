# Anonymous type member name must be preceded by a period
In the object initializer list for an anonymous type declaration, a new member name to which a value is assigned must be preceded by a period. The following example shows a valid and an invalid declaration:  
  
```vb  
' Valid.  
Dim instanceName1 = New With {.memberName = 10}  
' Invalid declaration that causes this error.  
' Dim instanceName2 = New With {memberName = 10}  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36575  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Add a period before the member name.
